/dht_nonblocking is the library given by the supplier of the dht11 sensor which is Elegoo. I simply use it in my project to get the readings.

/tests contains the testing files for the hardware. These are small sketches that test that the hardware is working.

project_code.ino is the project code file. It contains all the code for the project. The dht_nonblocking library needs to be installed tho.
